# erccdashboard-shiny-app
Shiny app for the erccdashboard R package

This Shiny app utilizes the R erccdashboard package to assess differential expression testing when using the ERCC controls. This app displays the output of the erccdashboard package and allows for some plot interaction to evaluate data points.

Current Limitations of app 

There are currently some limitations of the app that will hopefully be rectified upon updates to the erccdashboard package code. Currently only the Dynamic Range and MA plots are interactive. To obtain the console output click on the "Console Output" tab. In the current version runDashboard() is called a second time to display the console. This is not ideal or efficient. Further updates to this will occur when the dashboard code is update. Reactivity of app is not working quite as intended. It appears if console tab is click prior to plots tab this can alter what is presented and display will be incomplete. Again there is an issue within erccdashbord that could be leading to the problem and will be addressed upon update. If running this app it is currently recommended that user inputs all required information in info fields only once. If you wish to rerun with new values restart the app and re-enter for full output.

Run with test data set 

If you run the app using the supplied MET.CTL.countDat.csv dataset, load the data set use the browse button. Once the dataset is displayed adjust "Sample 1 Name" and "Sample 2 Name" to be "MET" and "CTL", respectively. Enter a prefix for output file name. All other fields are default values and appropriate for this dataset however this values can be overridden with input. Once all information is entered click on "erccdashboard Plot". This will execute the function runDashboard() and will take a couple of minutes to populate the tab with plots. To display the output from the console click on the "Console Output" tab. This will execute runDashboar() and display the console output along with the list object generated by the dashboard. Again with this take a couple of minutes to populate.
